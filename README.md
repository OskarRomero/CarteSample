Carte i an innovative digital menu and ordering platform built for restaurants. The platform's feature set is built intentionally with the diner in mind, improving their experience and reducing order friction. Features include the creation of customized menus, ingredients, images, dietary restrictions, prices. Carte's customers can find restaurants, dishes by dietary preferences & restrictions, order and pay on mobile device.

My role as a software engineer was to implement the functionality of the shopping cart. My contribution to this was to author all the code that that spanned the back-end, middle tier, and front-end of this shopping cart feature. Below is a list of of actions I took to get the cart up and running.

•	Created necessary tables, established foreign key relationships, and wrote stored procedures (executing joins and pagination) in SQL database

•	Created models, services, and API end points with .NET using C# and tested them with Postman

•	Designed the user interface using React.js, Javascript, Bootstrap and CSS for an aesthetically pleasing user experience and optimum performance

•	Care given to follow best practices and proper conventions regarding naming and casing to allow a better workflow among team members

•	Maintained workflow using GitBash and GitHub for version control. I performed commits, pull requests, and created branches as necessary

•	Participated in daily stand-ups, code review, and did code talks with team members to ensure cohesion in our code
